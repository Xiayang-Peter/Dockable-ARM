<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Produces the self-contained Steam build of Dockable (the part that can be automated), then prints
  the steamcmd command to upload it.

.DESCRIPTION
  Runs `dotnet publish` with the SteamRelease profile into src\Dockable\bin\Publish\Steam\win-x64\.
  Uploading to Steam still requires steamcmd + your Steamworks builder account (Steam Guard is
  interactive), so this script stops at "ready to upload" and tells you the exact command.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File steam\build-steam.ps1
