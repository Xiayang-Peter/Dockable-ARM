.SYNOPSIS
  Publishes Dockable as a single portable executable.

.DESCRIPTION
  Runs `dotnet publish` with the Portable profile, producing one self-contained Dockable.exe under
  src\Dockable\bin\Publish\Portable\win-x64\. It runs on any Windows 11 x64 machine with nothing
  installed — copy the single .exe anywhere and run it.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File scripts\build-portable.ps1

    [string]$Dotnet = "C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe"
